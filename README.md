# XIO-Operational Data KTC
### Data from Kibera Town Centre, Nairobi from 2016 to 2018

I am trying to introduce new tools to the KTC operation: github, Jupyter, Postman, cURL

I now can reach the XIO data in two ways: using the cURL notation, or using Postman.

* With cURL, it takes two steps: 1) log in, and receive a token. 2. Use token for further retrievals.  Data returns as JSON, so the next step is to copy it, then paste it into a web program that converts it to HTTP or to cvs.

* In Postman, the same, but entering the initial GET request is easier, and the token response can be copied and pasted inside Postman, with the copied token in an Authentication object.
